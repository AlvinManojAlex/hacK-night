# `hacK-night` website

The official website for HackClub VIT Chennai's `hacK-night` event.

## Contributing guide

- Use four spaces for indentation.
- Pretty-print code before pushing it.
- Avoid inline styles as far as possible.
- Avoid pngs as far as possible.
- Please try to keep styles for discrete pages in their own sheets and only add
  global styles to the `base.css`.
- Don't use &lt;br&gt; tags for visual layout - if you want a visual break you
  probably want a semantic break as well.
- Please don't duplicate existing assets.
